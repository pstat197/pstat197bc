    "text": "Expectations\nTime commitment. The course carries a time commitment of 12 hours per week (3 hours per credit unit). Class and project meetings account for roughly 2 hours per week, and class assignments are kept to a minimum to facilitate project work; thus, students should anticipate dedicating 8-10 hours outside of the classroom to project work each week. Students are strongly encouraged to establish a secondary meeting without their advisors each week to help ensure effective time and task management among the group.\nTeam contracts. Each team will develop a contract articulating their goals as a group, basic agreements about communication and collaboration, and steps that will be taken in the event of failure to uphold those agreements.\nTeam roles. Each student will take on one of the following roles per term by mutual agreement with their team:\n\na spokesperson who is responsible for communicating with advisors and course staff on behalf of the team;\na meeting organizer who is responsible for arranging project meetings and keeping time during meetings;\na note-taker who is responsible for maintaining a written record of each meeting;\na repository/data/document manager who is responsible for coordinating access to project files and keeping them organized;\nfor five-person teams, an equity manager who is responsible for ensuring a fair distribution of work among the team members.\n\nPeer review. Teams will conduct an anonymized peer review each quarter in which each student rates their teammates on:\n\ncooperation with the group;\ncommunication;\nadherence to with agreements established by the group contract;\nfulfillment of their assigned role;\nthe extent to which they contributed their fair share to project work.\n\nAggregated results will be used to provide individual feedback and identify any necessary interventions to improve quality of collaboration.\nClass presentations. Each team is expected to present some of their work once per term to the class. In-class presentations should be informal and allow time for intermittent discussion and questions. Teams should prepare about 10 slides and a 1-2 page handout. It is strongly recommended that just one team member give each presentation.\nPoster presentation. A public showcase of project work will be held on campus at the end of the Spring quarter. Each team is expected to prepare a poster to present at the showcase.\nNon-disclosure agreements. Some projects are subject to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the university and the sponsoring organization. If so, project advisors will notify students of the terms and share copies of the NDA; students are expected to uphold any such NDAs but should not directly sign any agreements."

    "text": "Policies\nAttendance. Regular attendance at class meetings is expected. Each student can miss one class meeting without notice; further absences may impact course grades. Students are responsible for material discussed in their absence and should review notes and consult a classmate.\nDeadlines. Students are expected to meet assignment deadlines in a timely manner. All deadlines have a 24-hour grace period. Late or amended work may or may not be accepted at the instructor’s discretion.\nEmail. Course staff will make their best effort to reply to email within 48 weekday hours. However, due to high volume, staff cannot guarantee that all messages will receive replies.\nIllness. Students who are ill are required to stay home. Students ill with COVID-19 must comply with university policy regarding reporting and isolation. Accommodations will be made to ensure that students absent due to illness do not fall behind.\nAccommodations. Reasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on the DSP website. Note: in this class there are no timed assessments.\nLetter grades. Letter grades are assigned based only on the assessments identified above and according to university guidelines, with the relative weighting of assessments determined at the discretion of the instructor. While grade calculations will not be disclosed, students are entitled to an explanation of the criteria used to determine their grades if desired. Grades will not be changed except in the case of clerical errors. If students feel their grade has been unfairly assigned, they are entitled to contest it following UCSB procedure for contesting grades.\nConduct. All course participants are expected to maintain respectful and honorable conduct consistent with UCSB ethical standards. Students uncomfortable with the behavior of another course participant for any reason should notify the instructor, course staff, or, if the complaint relates to course staff conduct, an administrative or departmental officer. Evidence of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC); evidence of problematic behavior will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accord with university policies."

    "section": "Expectations",
    "text": "Expectations\n\nAudience\nYou are writing for a broad audience. You can assume the reader is familiar with statistics and data science at about the same level as your peers, but should not assume they have any expertise in your area or with the data or methods you are using.\nAvoid jargon, define key terms or acronyms when they first appear, and dedicate space to explaining data and methodology carefully, but avoid over-explaining or providing excessive detail – you are describing research, not teaching a class.\n\n\nLength\nThe report should be no less than 5 pages and no more than 10 pages. If necessary, you can include supplementary material or appendices following the main body of the report or as separate files/documents.\n\n\nContent\nOrganize your report into the sections outlined below. Use subheadings as appropriate to your project to further differentiate report contents within sections. Whenever possible, please make subheadings specific (e.g., “Biological species surveys” is better than “Data”). In general, the headings and subheadings should provide an outline of the contents of a report that is easy for the reader to skim and informative.\n\nIntroduction\nIntroduce the topic of your project and provide any background needed to understand your work. Above all, your introduction should convey the primary motivation and potential value of your work. You are not expected to do a literature review, but if there is closely related prior work or your sponsor has provided you with a collection of relevant papers, you should summarize these and provide citations in the introduction. Close the introduction with a statement of your project objective(s) and a summary of the organization of the report.\nProblem(s) of interest\nConcisely state the problems you’re working on. These should be the high-level problems corresponding to the project objectives that you hope to solve by the end of the capstone – not practical/technical problems encountered along the way like data representation or wrangling, issues with model training or algorithm implementations, computational constraints, etc.\nIf your project has multiple arms, dedicate one short paragraph to each arm. Aim to sum up the problems of interest for each arm in just 1-3 sentences (not required, but a good aspiration).\nTip: If you find yourself struggling to summarize the problems of interest concisely or providing a lot of context or explanation, that’s probably a sign that you need to go back and revise your introduction.\nMaterials and methods\nDescribe your datasets and the statistical/computational techniques you are using to address the problems of interest. Provide high-level summaries of any key methods: if you are fitting a model, write the model clearly and explain how you estimate parameters; if you are designing an algorithm, write it up in pseudo-code; if you are performing hypothesis tests, state the hypotheses and indicate the test. This should be detailed but not long; if it begins to sprawl over many pages, that’s a sign that you need to edit it down.\nPreliminary findings\nPresent key findings from this quarter. Resist the temptation to describe everything you’ve done – focus just on the results that capture the most significant advances. Prepare a table or figure that helps to communicate each key finding with an appropriate caption. If you include a table or figure, you should also describe it in words and explain its significance. No tables or figures should appear that you do not also discuss in the text of the report.\nTip: start by preparing the tables and figures, determine the order to present them in, and then write this section around those elements.\nDiscussion\nThis is your opportunity to describe any particular challenges, interpretations of findings, and the like. Try to stick to the facts in the findings section, and use this section to explain how they relate to your problems of interest and project objectives.\nFuture work\nDescribe how you anticipate extending your project into spring quarter. Be specific. You do not need to present a detailed plan or timeline, but should convey what you expect to work on during Spring quarter. Use this as an opportunity to set goals and expectations for your group.\n\n\n\nFormat\nYour report should be in PDF (.pdf) or Word (.docx) format.\nCopies of any figures should be provided as separate images in JPEG, TIFF, or PNG format; images should have a resolution of at least 300 dots per inch (dpi).\nSupplementary material can be submitted in any format."
